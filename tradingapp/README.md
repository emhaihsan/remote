# Simple Trading Algorithm

This project implements a simple trading algorithm using Python, Streamlit, and various data science libraries. The algorithm utilizes the Moving Average Crossover strategy to generate buy/sell signals based on historical stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance.

## Features

- Fetch historical stock data using `yfinance`.
- Calculate short and long moving averages using `TA-Lib`.
- Generate buy/sell signals based on moving average crossovers.
- Backtest the trading strategy with a configurable initial balance.
- Display basic trading statistics such as total return, average daily return, and daily return standard deviation.
- Visualize stock price, moving averages, and buy/sell signals.
- Interactive Streamlit interface for user inputs and displaying results.

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run trading_app.py
```

This will start a local Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser.

## File Description

- `trading_app.py`: Contains the implementation of the trading algorithm and the Streamlit interface.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Detailed Explanation

### Fetch Historical Data

The function `fetch_data` fetches historical stock data for a given symbol and period using the `yfinance` library.

### Calculate Moving Averages

The function `calculate_moving_averages` calculates the short and long moving averages using `TA-Lib`.

### Generate Signals

The function `generate_signals` generates buy/sell signals based on the moving average crossover strategy.

### Backtest Strategy

The function `backtest_strategy` simulates trading based on the generated signals and calculates the final balance.

### Calculate Statistics

The function `calculate_statistics` computes basic statistics such as total return, average daily return, and daily return standard deviation.

### Plot Signals

The function `plot_signals` visualizes the stock price, moving averages, and buy/sell signals using `matplotlib`.
